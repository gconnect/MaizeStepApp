        Maize stemborer App is an android mobile application developed
        to assist farmers to remotely monitor the infiltration of the aggressive
        maize insect pests known as spodoptera species
        (Fall armyworm, African armyworm and Eygptian cotton leafworm) in the farm.\n\n
        The farmers using android phones would download this app via play store and install it.
        This platform would enable the farmers visualize these three species and determine their EIL and ET,
        then apply recommended control measures from Entomologist in order to control the pests in the field.

    <string name="control">
        <br> 1.	As soon as your app alerts you of the presence of borer especially FAW, AAW,
            ECLW or by observing the presence using step 2, proceed to step 3.\n\n</br>
        <br> 2.	Stem borer scouting for the moths possible presence in maize whorls and
            other visible signs, when presence of stem borer is established, then quickly move to step 3.\n\n</br>
        <br>3.  Do not allow moths density population exceed the Economic Threshold (ET) that is,
            the density of a pest at which control measures should be initiated to prevent an
            increasing pest population from reaching the Economic Injury Level (EIL) which is the
            smallest number of stem borers that would cause significant yield losses, proceed to step 4\n\n</br>
        <br>4.  Suppress the pest population by applying appropriate systemic or contact/systemic
            insecticide (consult your Agricultural Development Project (ADP) Officer or Crop
            Protectionist in your locality for appropriate and most suitable and current one
            in the market). Pursue step 5 with vigour.\n\n</br>
        <br>5.	For effective, coordinated, and flexible approach to manage alien invasive species
            such as FAW, AAW, ECLW, scout for its presence as in step 2 and treat your farms as well
            so as to ensure a wide range coverage. \n\n</br>
        <br>6.	Ensure farm sanitation and other cultural control measures alongside use of
            resistant variety and other biological control especially before the onset of planting
            (Consult relevant ADP Officer and plant Protectionist too).\n\n</br>
        <br>7.	Leveraging interactions between complementary approaches in order to maximize
            control of the pest while minimizing potential risks to human and animal health,
            the environment, and natural enemies of the pest (adhere strictly to the Insecticide
            manufacturerâ€™s instructions regarding frequency of application, quantity to be applied etc.)
            NB: consult insecticide data manufacturing sheet for details.\n\n</br>
        <br>8.	Effective monitoring should synchronize the stem borer count visa viz the maize
            growth stage. E.g, moth counts can be as low as one moth per day which is enough
            indication to plan for control. So as to arrest the borer from reaching its egg
            laying potential. \n\n</br>
        <br>9.	Base your action on plant growth and other relevant factors such as canopy density,
            dead heart, signs of infestation e.g. on leaves, should call for immediate chemical
            control options as in step 4.\n\n</br>
